<!-- 9. **Using `setInterval` with Promises:**
 - Write a function called `repeatAction` that takes an action (a function), an interval (in milliseconds), and a duration (in
milliseconds). Use `setInterval` to repeatedly execute the action at the specified interval, but stop after the specified
duration. Return a Promise that resolves when the repeating action stops. -->

function repeatAction(action, interval, duration) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        const intervalId = setInterval(action, interval);

        setTimeout(() => {
            clearInterval(intervalId);
            resolve();
        }, duration);
    });
}

repeatAction(() => console.log("Action!"), 1000, 5000).then(() => console.log("Finished repeating action."));
